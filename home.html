  <h1 style="color:midnightblue;">Basic Thai for beginners (including pronunciation)</h1>
  <h3 style="background-color:maroon;">
 A couple months ago, I decided to set a challenge for myself to learn Thai. Thai is a difficult language to learn, but once you know basic Thai such as the words below, learning longer phrases or sentences should come across naturally in the future.
      If you struggle with pronunciation as I did, there are always websites and youtube videos to help you. One thing to note first is that when saying a sentence, 'Ka' is used for women and 'Khrup' for men, they are polite words to use at the end of a sentence and show respect. Because I am a woman, I used 'ka' in my examples.</h3>
      <h3 style="background-color:darkgrey;"> Yes </h1>

    <h3 style="background-color:maroon;">A Thai/Australian actor called Perth Nakhun was kind enough to make videos to help international fans understand Thai more. He too didn't understand Thai until a few years ago as he was brought up speaking English but then he learnt Thai (because he is half Thai) along with Japanese. Him and some other Thai actors are what inspired me myself to learn Thai as I watch a few Thai TV shows and it'd be nice to understand what they say some day without using subtitles. </h3>
    <h3 style="background-color:midnightblue;">Below are a few videos I have used in helping me to understand basic Thai and pronounce words correctly: </h3>
<h3> Video 1 - Learning how to say Hello! How are you? Thank you!</h3>
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq5siCINHX8&list=WL&index=2'> BasicThai#1</a>
<h3> Video 2 - Learning how to count from 0-10</h3>
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPxNPuhxek'> BasicThai#2</a>
<h3> Video 3 - Learning how to say 'me and you', asking what someone's name is and how old they are</h3>
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dool3afWWiQ'> BasicThai#3</a>
<h3 style="background-color:maroon;"> Once you have watched these videos, you should have a basic understanding of Thai. Rewatching these videos and researching words has helped me personally to understand Thai more and correct my pronunciations. Hopefully I'll be able to speak and type long sentences in the future and hopefully this will help someone else too.  </h3>
